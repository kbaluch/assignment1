			In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
			Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
			that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

			This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
			No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

			If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
			the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!
